However, if you throw balls with different denominations, nothing happens and they just start piling up, filling up the playing area. This complicates the game and can lead to a loss. To make things easier, the game has boosters that allow you to clear a pile of uncollected marbles. However, to earn these boosters, you need to try to collect a few balls at a time.
