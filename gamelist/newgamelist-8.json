During that process, you have to escape the guard's sight. If he catches you, the game will be over. So, try to avoid getting caught by the guard's radar!!",

Compete with your friends, go further and further.\nUnlock new and new levels.\n\nIn the game Blocku Golf 2 every level. All you have to do is kick the ball into the hole. That's all !\nBut there is one rule: in order to pass the level, you will only have 5 values. Only 5 ratings! In addition, you are waiting for other obstacles on the way to success. These are moving platforms, blocks, chasms, sharp saws and explosive TNT. How do you like that?\n\nBut first of all, Blocku Golf 2 is a very addicting and fun game that combines minimalism and addictive gameplay, steeped in hardcore level passing, like in the good old Bounce or Gravity Defied.\n\nHurry up to pass the level after the increase!",

Help him put out all of the fires on each level by shooting each fire with a powerful blast from his hose. The blast of water from the hose packs a wallop and can ricochet off objects to put out fires, but be careful as a bad ricochet can easily knock the fireman out.
