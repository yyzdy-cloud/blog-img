        "Key Features": "The game board showcases a captivating arrangement of dark, purplish-blue blocks, forming an intricate checkerboard pattern. Unlike many other 10x10 puzzle games, \"11+11 Bloxx\" introduces a unique element by presenting various patterns across 12 distinct levels. Some of these patterns incorporate blocks resembling immovable stones, which pose a challenge as they obstruct the creation of 11-block lines. Nonetheless, the game compensates by awarding you coins and points for eliminating smaller lines in these scenarios.\n\nProgressing in the game requires you to conquer one level to unlock the next. While it's possible to remove lines one at a time, opting for combination moves to clear multiple lines simultaneously earns you higher point rewards.\n\n11+11 Bloxx\" enriches the block-puzzle experience with several enhancements. The coins you earn can be wisely invested in power-ups, extending your gameplay by increasing available space on the board. These power-ups grant you the ability to swap two blocks, eliminate individual blocks, clear groups of blocks by type, or remove a specified quantity of blocks. The game introduces these power-up options when you run out of moves, or you can access and purchase them using the lightning bolt button.\n\nFurthermore, your accumulated coins unlock the option to acquire diverse block types, including round blocks, blocks adorned with stripes, and flat tiles. This diversity in block types adds an additional layer of strategic depth to your gameplay.",
