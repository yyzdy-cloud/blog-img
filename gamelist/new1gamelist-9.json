These include new weapons, weapon upgrades, barricade upgrades, general and unique upgrades.\nThe power level of the enemies are increased as time passes and eventually it becomes impossible to defend the Town Hall against them, the better you choose and combine your upgrades, the more zombies you can kill until this happens.\nThere are 9 zombie types that behave differently from each other, sharing the only similarity that they have a brainless tunnel vision on destroying the Town Hall.\nThere are 50 completely different visual representations of these zombies so they don't really feel repetitive.\nThe game contains a fully narrated Tutorial that you can opt to try from the absolutely simple \"main menu\".\nOnce the game is over you can check a quite detailed statistics about the session you've just  played.",
