The style of the game is reminiscent of the famous game Mine Craft, which will allow you to re-immerse yourself in the atmosphere of pixel style.\nAfter completing each level, you can unlock new items, get rubies to compete with other players on the rankings.\nIn order for the game not to seem boring to you, we have added pickaxes, like in Mine Craft. As your level increases, you can buy stronger pickaxes to break new types of blocks. The higher level the block you smash, the cooler merge items you'll get on the table.\nWith its voxel-style three-dimensional graphics, pickaxe pumping system, and unique match-finding game mechanics, Voxel Merge 3D stands out from all other games.\nYou'll love our game. Enjoy and good luck.",

Quickly select and match three or more of the same colored diamonds. Blow them up to earn points. Keep the fun going until you run out of lives. How high of a score can you get in this fun yet crazy matching game? Make sure to match the same colored stones next to each other on the wonderful wheel of fortune. Avoid filing up the slots with unmatched diamonds to face any unwanted penalty! Use your puzzle-solving and brain-wits to make the maximum possible matches before you run out of luck! Remember this wheel will keep flipping tiles or shooting bubbles so your focus skills will help you get through all the hurdles. Try to position the diamonds that stick out of it by rotating the inner ring!",
